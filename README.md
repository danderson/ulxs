I'm playing with FPGAs, specifically a UL3XS board. This is a
repository for my Nix dev environment config, and experiments.  I
can't imagine why this is of interest, but enjoy, I guess.

Everything in this repository is CC-BY-NC-ND. Broadly speaking, that
means you can look, but not touch or reuse without my explicit
permission.

This repo does not accept contributions.
