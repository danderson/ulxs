I'm playing with FPGAs, specifically a UL3XS board. This is a repository for my Nix dev environment config, and experiments.
I can't imagine why this is of interest, but enjoy, I guess.

While you're welcome to look, this project is not Open Source. You can look. You cannot use any of this
for any purpose without my approval. This project does not accept issues, pull requests, or any kind of
contribution.

Again, I'm not sure why you're here, but you're welcome to have a look around, I suppose.
